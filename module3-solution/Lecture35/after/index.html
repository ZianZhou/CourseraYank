    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. The Chicken Farm Have you ever imagined what a chicken farm looked like? Have you seen the troubles a hen goes through before laying an egg? What about an egg about to hatch? Have you felt the excitement as you anticipate its coming out into this world? What about the details in taking good care of a hen? Did you know that there are more chickens than humans on Earth? People would normally equate the word farm with boring, tedious, strenuous, and mundane. They would discourage whoever talks about going into farming. From sunrise to sundown, farmers would normally do the same thing. However, there is more to farming than the drudgeries of routine work. This is what the article is about. It will show you how people could learn something about a chicken farm in a fun way. You will get acquainted with the different stages in raising chickens. You don’t need a farm to know and experience all of this. You might want to try the various activities we have prepared for you on our farm. These activities were designed both for the old and the young; for those who’ve tried raising chickens and those who’ve don’t have the slightest idea. Whether you want to go for education or for fun, no worries, we have both. It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. 
      When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. 
      First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not.  
      Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. 
      Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. 
      Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” 
      In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

    <h3>Beef</h3>
    <p>
      Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients. The production of beef produces requires a lot of energy and leaves a huge carbon footprint on planet earth. The process of producing beef goes far beyond raising cattle. It includes heavy water use, immense amounts of land to grow grain and/or corn, and requires an almost endless amount transportation. We have to consider not only the amount of land the cattle physically occupy, but also the amount of land used to grow the huge amount of food they require. To put it into perspective, the production of beef uses “30% of the earth’s land mass” (Peta 2013). In addition, it takes 31.5kWh of energy to produce 1lb of beef, approximately 58lbs of CO2 emissions (Federal Register 2010). Speaking of energy, the amount of grain fed to cattle is staggeringly high. Including beef cattle and dairy cattle if all that feed “were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million" (Pimentel, David 2014). And yet another aspect of this, perhaps an externality effect on the environment is deforestation, land dehydration, and contamination of water sources from runoff.
      Another aspect we looked at was water consumption. The amount of water required to raise cattle for beef is shockingly high. And a lot of this is not only due to the direct consumption of water by the cattle, but the indirect consumption through the food they eat. The crops themselves require a lot of water as well. Combine the water for agriculture for the beef cattle and the direct consumption of water and we find that “nearly half of the water used in the United States” is strictly used for the beef cattle industry.

    <h3>Sushi</h3>
    <p>
      Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi. The Japanese live long, and this is already a well known fact. One of the proven secrets of longevity is that they eat fish, a lot of them. ‚·‚µ, the highlight of their fish cuisine, became very popular all over the world and had been representing Japanese food ever since. There is even a word in English: Sushi. There are numerous types of sushi such as nigiri-sushi, maki-sushi, and sashimi.
      In the 7th century, Southeast Asians introduced the technique of pickling. After 500 years, the Japanese acquired this same practice which consisted of packing fish with rice. As the fish fermented, the rice produced a lactic acid which in turn caused the pickling of the pressed fish. This was the very first form of sushi, and it was called Nare-Sushi. Then in 15th and 16th century, an altered form, Nama-Nare, appeared due to lengthy process. After a century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo introduced the use of rice vinegar into the sushi rice to add a flavor of tartness. One of the best known kinds of sushi, nigiri, wasnft introduced until 1820fs by Hanaya Yohei of Edo. His morsels, which included fresh sliced raw fish combined with the vinegared rice, were prepared and served for customers directly from his portable sushi stall. It eventually won immediate demands over the nation and descended the sushi bars of today. One of the typical nigiri sushi we eat is maguro, tuna sushi. In my experience, therefs not just one tuna sushi, but quite a few, such as an albacore tuna, a white tuna, a fatty tuna, and the regular tuna. Just like other sushi, vinegared rice and a piece of tuna are, at least, required to make a tuna sushi. Once they are ready, by taking a small portion of the rice to the middle of a hand, pressing it with fingers to make it form nicely round and fairly long, and placing a sliced tuna on top of it, maguro is made.It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler.
